# SNAPSHOT_EDIT

## GOAL

Your final task is to create a simple camera app, where you can take photos and then apply edits to those snapshots.
The edits that we want are doodles/shapes/icons/text/.../ or any creative combination that will 
allow the photographer to use the snapshot as teaching tool.

## TASKS

1. Create empty scaffold that asks for needed permissions on the start. If the permission were not granted, 
there will be a button in the body to ask for permissions again..
2. Create FAB with camera icon in the bottom, that will be visible once the permission were granted. 
Pressing the button will open the camera.
3. Create an option to take a snapshot and save it or delete it.
4. Add edit option on snapshot, it will open edit screen.
5. Add any edit option that you prefer.
